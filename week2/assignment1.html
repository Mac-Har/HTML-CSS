        <h1>Let's get this over with, by They Might be Giants</h1>
        <h2>The drumbeat never changes tempo</h2>
        <h2>Its steady like a rock</h2>
        <h2>and like a rock it crushes you as it gets louder</h2>
        <h2>the drum gets louder</h2>
        <h2>and louder</h2>
        <h2>and you know there is no parking on the dance floor</h2>
        <h2>and when you wake up you can feel your hair grow</h2> <!--Chorus-->
        <h2>Crawl of you cave and you can watch your shadow</h2>
        <h2>creep across the ground until the day is done</h2>
        <h2>all the while the planet circles round the sun</h2>
        <h2>everybody knows how this goes so lets get</h2>
        <h2>and lets get this over with</h2>
        <h2>Even when your out of work you still have a job to do</h2>
        <h2>even when you dont know what it is your job knows what it is</h2>
        <h2>what it is</h2>
        <h2>is its coming to get you</h2>
        <h2>Im talking to myself even when im saying 'You'.</h2>
        <h2>and when you wake up you can feel your hair grow</h2> <!--Chorus-->
        <h2>Crawl of you cave and you can watch your shadow</h2>
        <h2>creep across the ground until the day is done</h2>
        <h2>all the while the planet circles round the sun</h2>
        <h2>everybody knows how this goes so lets get</h2>
        <h2>and lets get this over with</h2>
        <h2>after all the spelling mistakes</h2>
        <h2>after all the groping in the dark</h2>
        <h2>cant this page of strange gibberish</h2>
        <h2>get a final punctuation mark?</h2>
        <h2>Youre still hanging around the clambake</h2>
        <h2>after every clam has been baked</h2>
        <h2>No applause</h2>
        <h2>Awkward pause</h2>
        <h2>Hand extended waiting for a shake</h2>
        <h2>and when you wake up you can feel your hair grow</h2> <!--Chorus-->
        <h2>Crawl out of you cave and you can watch your shadow</h2>
        <h2>creep across the ground until the day is done</h2>
        <h2>all the while the planet circles round the sun</h2>
        <h2>everybody knows how this goes so lets get</h2>
        <h2>and lets get this over with</h2>
        <h2>Hurry up and lets get this over with</h2>
        <h2>You dont have to go home but you cant stay here</h2>
        <h2>everybody knows how this goes so lets get over it</h2>
        <h2>and lets get this over with.</h2>
